    "Bayes's theorem is a means for revising predictions in light of relevant evidence, also known as conditional probability or inverse probability.

A quick test for HIV can be conducted, but it is not infallible: almost all individuals who have been infected long enough to produce an immune system response can be detected, but very recent infections may go undetected. In addition, “false positive” test results (that is, false indications of infection) occur in 0.4 percent of people who are not infected; therefore, the probability Pr −H (E) is 0.004, where E is a positive result on the test."

Since we are dealing with a normal distribution and a large sample size (n > 30), we can use the standard normal distribution (z-distribution) to determine the critical value. For a 95% confidence level, the critical value is 1.96.\n",

However, if we increase the sample size to 100 and calculate the 95% confidence interval again, we might get a smaller margin of error, say 2 cm.
